## v8.0.0 (2022-12-01)

#### :boom: Breaking Change
* Drop Node.js v12, v13 and v14 Support
* Transition code base from CommonJS to ESM
  * This should not affect WebdriverIO users as you can use the testrunner, as well as `webdriver`, `devtools` and `webdriverio` NPM packages in a CJS environment
  * We still mark this as breaking as we can't gurantee that all (untested) functionality will behave the same due to all rewrites done to the code base
* Removal of `@wdio/sync` which we deprecated in v7
* WebdriverIO types are now accessible through `@wdio/globals/types` instead of `webdriverio/async`
* Removal of `browser.config`
  * Please use `browser.options` instead
  * This will stop support assigning custom properties to the `wdio.conf.js` which we disadvise you to do, instead either assign it as part of a custom capability, e.g. `custom:options` (note the `:` in it, read more on custom capabilities in the [WebDriver spec](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#capabilities)) or via [`@wdio/shared-store-service](https://webdriver.io/docs/shared-store-service)
* discontinued support for [`tsconfig-paths`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig-paths)

#### :rocket: New Feature
* New [runner plugin](https://webdriver.io/docs/runner) called `@wdio/browser-runner` allows you to run unit and component tests in the browser
* Access WebdriverIO primitives through the new [`@wdio/globals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wdio/globals) package
* New [Action API](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/action)

#### :house: Internal
* Update required Node.js version for development to `v18.12.1`
* Migrate unit tests from Jest to Vitest

#### :nail_care: Polish
* Improvements on configuration wizard and `create-wdio`
  * It now detects whether your projects uses ESM or CJS and creates example files accordingly
  * It now finds the project root and sets up the project relative to it
  * Adds support for browser runner selection

#### :memo: Documentation
* Little design tweaks to the hero section on the main page
* Added new section for component testing
* Added new API section for browser, element, mock objects, modules and environment variables
